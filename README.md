## Checklist

Issues and blockers can't always be predicted and writing software under time pressure is hard. It's okay if you don't get everything done. Include the following section in your own README file and cross (`[x]`) the things you were able to do.

### Must have
- [x] Data model that fully represents the described system
- [x] Homepage listing projects and folders
- [x] Topics filter on the homepage

### Nice to have
- [x] Info page for a folder **(started but not finished)**
- [ ] Admin interface to create new projects
- [ ] Admin interface to edit existing projects

### Bonus
We prefer that you focus on covering the base requirements. Quality over quantity. In case you'd have time left, here are some bonus things you could amaze us with.

- [ ] Make the topic filter on the homepage also apply to folders, by looking at the projects within the folder
- [ ] Add breadcrumbs to the project/folder info pages
- [ ] Support images for projects/folders
- [ ] Let admins define the order of projects and folders themselves
- [ ] ... Surprise us!
